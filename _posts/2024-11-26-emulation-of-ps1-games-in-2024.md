While studying algorithms, I decided to listen to music from some of my favorite PS1 games. I was surprised to find that some of them still sounded great. I decided to see if I could get them running in 2024.

## Background
A few years ago I was able to setup ePSXe, a PS1 emulator, on my laptop and desktop. While it was a great emulator, it required a lot of manual setup. I wanted to see if I could get some PS1 games running in 2024 without all the hassle.

## RetroArch: A Modern Solution
I was pleasantly surprised that RetroArch had a PS1 core. I had never used it before but it worked great. I was able to get all my games running in a few minutes on both Mac and Windows.

## BIOS Setup
Similar to other emulators, RetroArch requires BIOS files for the PS1. Thankfully, there are many resources online to learn how to obtain them. I do own a PS1 so all of this was legal.

## Memory Card Management
I found memory card saves way more manageable on RetroArch than ePSXe. On RetroArch, the memory must match the name of the ISO or BIN file (ROM) but have the save extension (.ism on Mac and .sav on Windows). This makes it easier to find the correct memory card file for a game. Simply renaming the save file allows you to effectively have unlimited saves for every game (This would have been heaven back in the day of PS1 consoles).

## Controller Support
DualShock controllers are automatically detected and work great. The button layout pre-populates based on the game and it matches the original controller layout. This is not the case for ePSXe, where the user has to manually map the buttons or use other software such as DS4Windows.

## Game Modding Experience
I tried a MOD for Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories called Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories Mod Perfect. It was close enough to the original and the small improvements they made, made it close to perfect so I found the name fitting.

## Quality of Life Features
Like ePSXe, RetroArch supports save states and fast forwards. These 2 features enhances the gaming experience tremendously. While some games were fun because of how hard they were, it is nice to be able to save even when it wasn't possible to do so on the game itself. For parts that are not skippable, the fast-forward function is a lifesaver.

## Conclusion
Overall, I was impressed with how well RetroArch worked. I was able to get all my games running in a few minutes. While there might be some games that won't work due to licensing issues, it was a fun experiment that made revisiting classic PS1 games much more accessible.
